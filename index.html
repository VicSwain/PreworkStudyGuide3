                <li>Git is version control system that lets you mange and keep track of every version of your projects</li>
                <li>GitHub is a cloud hosting service that we use to track changes in code and store this changes as versions inside remote repositories</li>
                <li>GitHub is crucial for collaborating with others</li>
                <li>GitHub can have repos owned by one developer and shared with a team</li>
                <li>You clone your repo from GitHub to your local device to work on code without breaking the main branch</li>
                <li>It is important for you to create and work on your on branch local</li>
                <li>Pull request is asking for your code to be reviewed and merged with the main branch following reviewal</li>
                <li>GitHub workflow: Create a branch, make changes, create a pull request, address/review comments, merge your pull request, delete your branch</li>
                <li> git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
                <li>git checkout -b (branch-name): created a new branch and switchs to it</li>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript add interactivity to a website</li>
              <li>Browser reads code in the order it appears in the file</li>
              <li>If JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that has not loaded yet, problems can ensue</li>
              <li>Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page</li>
              <li>let (statement);declares a variable with ; to indicate where the statment ends</li>
              <li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
              <li>To signify a value as a string enclose it in single or double quote marks</li>
              <li>A number as a variable does not have quotes around them</li>
              <li>Boolean is a True/Fale value</li>
              <li>The value true and false are special keywords that do not need quote marks</li>
              <li>Array is a struction that allows you to store multiple values as a single reference</li>
              <li>An Object as a variable can be anything. Everything in JS is an oject and can be stored</li>
              <li>(/* */) eveything in between the slash is a comment</li>
              <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables</li>
              <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not</li>
              <li>Function are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse</li>
              <li>Functions often take arugments: bits of data needed to do their job</li>
              <li>Event handlers are code structures that listen for activity in the browswer</li>
              <li>Variable in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type</li>
              <li>Any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types</li>
              <li>All types except Object define immutable values referred to as primitave values</li>
              <li>Primitave values are represented directly at the lowest level of the language</li>
              <li>The Null type is inhabited by exactly one value: null</li>
              <li>undefined is the absence of a value; null indicates the absence of an object</li>
              <li>The most important place ofr null is the end of the prototype chain</li>
              <li>Boolean type represents a logical entitiy that is inhabited by two values: true and false</li>
              <li>Boolean values are usually used for conditional operations, includer ternary operators, if...else,while, etc.</li>
              <li>The number type is capable of storing postive floating-point numbers</li>
              <li>You can check if a number is safe for a number type by using Number.isSafeInteger()</li>
              <li>BigInt type is a numeric pimitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magniture.</li>
              <li>BigInt allows you to safely store and operate on integers beyond the safe interget limit</li>
              <li>String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units</li>
              <li>JavaScript Strings are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it</li>
              <li>Use strings for textual data. When representing complex data, parse stings, and use the appropriate abstraction</li>
              <li>Symbol is a unique and immutable primitave value and may be used as the key of an Object property</li>
              <li>The purpose of symbols is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code</li>
              <li>An object is a value in memory which is possible referenced in an identifier</li>
              <li>In JavaScript objects are the only mutable values</li>
              <li>in JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties</li>
              <li>Two types of object properties: data property and the accessor property</li>
              <li>JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchangable format, derived from JavaScript, but used in many languages</li>
              <li>Primitave Coercion process is used where a primitive value is expected, but there's no strong preference for what the actual type should be</li>
              <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a ";"</li>
              <li>script.js file is linked within the body element</li>
              <li>JavaScript control flow runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
              <li>We define topics AFTER we tell the computer to log it i the console</li>
              <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed</li>
              <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
              <li>Arrays are especially useful when you want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data</li>
              <li>A single array can store different types of data</li>
              <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need an index, which is a unique number that is hte location of the data item in the array</li>
              <li>JavaScript and many other languagues are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
              <li>A for loop used the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an arry by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
              <li>To use a for loop we need varible's index and the array's length</li>
              <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
              <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run, it must be called by name</li>
              <li>This is added to learn</li>
              <li></li>
